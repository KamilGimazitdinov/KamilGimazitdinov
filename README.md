# Brief information about me #
    As you already understand, my name is Kamil. I was born and raised in Izhevsk. I'm 23 years old. I will write about myself briefly: I am purposeful, easy to learn, sociable and executive. I have no experience in development, but over the past few days, thanks to your platform, I have gained a lot of useful knowledge and skills that will be necessary to achieve my goals. 
    I want to share them with you. They are quite simple. First, I want to learn Frontend development, and second, I want to work and develop in this direction. I have always been interested in learning how to create the interface of programs and projects. I admire people who know how to make money with their minds.Even now I can hardly understand some of the material, but it's good. This is a great opportunity for me to show my desire and test myself.
